# Majority Element

## Question

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example

### Example 1

**Input:**

    nums = [3,2,3]

**Output:**

    3

**Explanation:**

    The number 3 appears 2 times which is more than 3 (length of the array) divided by 2.

### Example 2

**Input:**

    nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

**Output:**

    2

**Explanation:**

    The number 2 appears 4 times which is more than 7 (length of the array) divided by 2.

## Solution

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[nums.length/2];
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums)//2]
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        return nums[nums.size()/2];
    }
};
```

Please note that the code provided in Java, Python, and C++ all follow the same logic. They sort the array and return the element at the middle index. Since the majority element always exists and appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, it is guaranteed to be at the middle index after sorting.
