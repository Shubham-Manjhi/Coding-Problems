# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Question

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.

## Example

### Example 1

**Input:**

    nums = [1,1,2]

**Output:**

    2, nums = [1,2,_]

**Explanation:**

    Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
    It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Example 2

**Input:**

    nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

**Output:**

    5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]

**Explanation:**

    Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
    It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

## Solution

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        i = 0
        for j in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]
        return i + 1
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
};
```

Please note that the code provided in Java, Python, and C++ all follow the same logic. They use two pointers, one for iterating the array and the other for keeping track of the position where the next unique element should be placed. When a unique element is found, it is moved to the position of the second pointer, and then the second pointer is incremented. The function returns the position of the second pointer plus one, which is the number of unique elements.
